# Overview
VBA macros, user interface, and Excel sheet have been developed to facilitate project time tracking. This system enables users to record the time spent on each project, including task details, dates, and descriptions (e.g., "I spent 1 hour working on tasks for Client A, completing this and that"). The creation of this project arose out of a practical need, and although the technology stack (VBS + Excel) may not be perfect, it offers a significant advantage because It is specifically designed for usage within closesly controlled environments where the use of external applications is restricted, assuming Excel is present.

# How to use it?
To begin, download the "timer.xmls" file and open it using Microsoft Excel. Please note that you may need to enable macros in order to proceed.

# Source code and macros

The source code of the macros was exported from the sheet using [Rubberduck](https://rubberduckvba.com/). If you intend to make modifications to the source code, you may need to install this tool.
